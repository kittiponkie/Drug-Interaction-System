Welcome and thanks to use and contribute to this project. Your support is very important.

If you found any problem / bug during the use of uiv, or have any suggustion that can make this lib better, please [create an issue](https://github.com/wxsms/uiv/issues/new). 

Pull requests are also welcome! However, before you started working on a PR, it is highly recommend to **create an issue with your idea first**, so people can know what's going to happen and avoid duplicated work. After that, pls make PRs to the `dev` branch.
